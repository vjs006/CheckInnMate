## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The Hotel Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to
streamline and optimize the operations of a modern hotel. This system provides a
user-friendly interface for hotel staff, administrators, and guests, facilitating efficient
management of various tasks related to reservations, billing, facilities, and customer
interactions.

## MOTIVATION FOR THE PROBLEM
Our motivation for the problem lies strongly in the fact that this topic involves OOPS
concepts in the various aspects of its working. Whether it be the Rooms hierarchy,
Amenity hierarchy, or the User hierarchy, there is always an element of Object Oriented
Principles in it. The problem is also something which is relevant in the real world, where
many hotels require an application for their management. We believe that pursuing this
project would enhance not only our knowledge of OOPs concepts but also our general
coding skills and understanding of how to solve real world problems. Also working with
a front end enhances our understanding of how to bring code to visual life as well.
Overall, this project is something that we as a group intended to learn from, and having
completed it, can certainly say that it has done so for sure.

## SCOPE
The Hotel Management System has a broad scope, encompassing various aspects of hotel
operations, guest management, and amenities. The key components and their scope are :
● User Management:
The system manages different user roles, such as administrators, users and guests.
It ensures secure and efficient account management for each user.
● Reservation System:
Provides a streamlined process for guests to make reservations.
Tracks and manages room reservations, including check-in and check-out procedures.
● Billing System:
Handles billing for room charges and additional services. Supports smooth and
transparent billing procedures for guests.
● Room Management:
Defines a flexible room hierarchy. Optimizes room management processes, such as
assigning guests, checking room occupancy, and handling room-specific features.
● Feedback System:
Includes a feedback system for guests to provide insights. Demonstrates a commitment
to continuous improvement based on user and guest feedback.
● Facility Management:
Manages various hotel facilities and amenities. Ensures efficient utilization of amenities,
such as gyms, swimming pools, game rooms, and mini-bars.
● Guest Experience:
Prioritizes guest satisfaction through personalized services and efficient handling of
reservations and requests. Aims to enhance the overall guest experience during their
stay.

## LIMITATIONS
● One major drawback of the system is that, the front-end is made using Swing of
Java. Swing, the Java GUI toolkit, has drawbacks including variable look and feel
across operating systems, heavyweight components impacting performance, a
steep learning curve, limited support for modern UI features, and challenges in
integrating with JavaFX. Its outdated appearance, performance concerns, and
lack of native mobile support also make it less suitable for contemporary desktop
and mobile application development compared to newer frameworks.
● The system is made to be locally accessed and used. The absence of portability
or remote access in a system results in limited accessibility, reduced flexibility,
and a dependence on specific physical infrastructure. This can lead to increased
downtime and hinders the adaptability of the system to different devices and
environments.
